# Arcade-N


ARCADE-N is a clinical physiotherapy support system that gives the user a personalized experience to perform upper-limb exercises. As a method of encouraging patients to perform the proposed exercises, ARCADE-N encompasses a narrative by chapters that is unraveled over four sessions. This narrative was based on comics indicated by our user group as something that brings them happy childhood moments.

ARCADE-N was built in Unity and uses the Kinect device as a motion-tracker. ![main_menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72517314/200346047-60bb09c8-bd97-4f37-b6d1-50f7f4cfaab8.png)
